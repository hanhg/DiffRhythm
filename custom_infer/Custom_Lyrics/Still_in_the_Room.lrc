[00:00.00]I pour two cups of coffee, like I always do  
[00:07.15]One for me, one for the ghost of you  
[00:14.12]The chair still creaks the way you left it  
[00:20.98]Your coat still hangs, I can't forget it  

[00:27.31]The silence screams louder than your voice  
[00:33.74]I’d trade the sun for one more choice  

[00:40.28]You're still in the room, though you’re gone  
[00:46.83]I reach through shadows just to hold on  
[00:52.95]Every laugh, every fight, every tear we knew  
[00:59.12]Plays on repeat like a worn-out tune  
[01:05.36]They say time heals, but they never knew you  
[01:11.74]I'm not letting go—I don’t know how to  

[01:18.15]The photos lie, they never age  
[01:24.42]While I get older, trapped on the same page  
[01:30.98]Your sweater still smells like your cologne  
[01:37.21]God, this house don’t feel like home  

[01:43.59]I talk to you like you're still here  
[01:50.03]And sometimes I swear, I feel you near  

[01:56.44]You're still in the room, though you’re gone  
[02:02.78]I reach through shadows just to hold on  
[02:09.24]Every laugh, every fight, every tear we knew  
[02:15.45]Plays on repeat like a worn-out tune  
[02:21.67]They say time heals, but they never knew you  
[02:28.09]I'm not letting go—I don’t know how to  

[02:34.45]I see you in dreams, but morning steals you away  
[02:41.04]And the light of day feels colder that way  
[02:47.28]People move on, but I’m still stuck  
[02:53.81]In a yesterday I can't give up  

[03:00.14]You're still in the room, in every song  
[03:06.41]In the quiet, in the dusk, in the dawn  
[03:12.82]Every promise we made, every plan we drew  
[03:19.27]Lingers on like the scent of you  
[03:25.52]They say the pain fades—but that’s not true  
[03:31.93]You're still in my heart, and I’m still in love with you
