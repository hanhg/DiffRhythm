[00:00.00]She’s a city girl, lost in neon lights  
[00:06.40]He’s a country boy, chasing open nights  
[00:12.70]Both running from the lives they know too well  
[00:18.90]Searching for a place where their stories swell  

[00:25.20]On the midnight train through the pouring rain  
[00:30.60]They find each other to ease the pain  
[00:36.80]A quiet smile in the crowded car  
[00:42.10]Two strangers wishing on the same star  

[00:48.50]The rails hum softly beneath their feet  
[00:54.00]A rhythm of hope, a promise sweet  
[01:00.30]Life’s a road full of turns unknown  
[01:06.00]But together, they’re not alone  

[01:12.40]Tracks of tomorrow, leading them on  
[01:17.80]Through the dark till the break of dawn  
[01:24.10]Two hearts beating out a hopeful song  
[01:29.50]On the journey where they both belong  

[01:35.90]She laughs softly as the city fades  
[01:41.30]He breathes in deep the mountain shades  
[01:47.60]In that moving world, they find their place  
[01:53.00]Side by side, face to face  

[01:59.40]Tracks of tomorrow, leading them on  
[02:04.90]Through the dark till the break of dawn  
[02:11.20]Two hearts beating out a hopeful song  
[02:16.60]On the journey where they both belong
