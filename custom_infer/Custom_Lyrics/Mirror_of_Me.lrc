[00:00.00]Mirror talk back, “Do you know who you are?”  
[00:04.50]I’ve been dodgin' lies like I’m duckin' a car  
[00:08.30]Wore too many faces just to fit in the scene  
[00:12.10]Now I’m strippin' 'em off just to breathe in between  

[00:15.90]They told me "be real," but they play pretend  
[00:19.70]Said “ride or die,” then they switched in the end  
[00:23.50]I got bruises turned lessons, pain turned flame  
[00:27.30]If I fall again, I’ll rise just the same  

[00:31.10]Yeah, trust ain't a word, it’s a weapon they swing  
[00:34.90]Fake love in the air, but I clip those wings  
[00:38.70]I don’t bend, don’t flinch, don’t chase no clout  
[00:42.50]If I speak, it’s truth — no shadow, no doubt  

[00:46.30]You can’t kill what’s been through war  
[00:50.10]Cut me deep, I just roar  
[00:53.90]I don’t break — I transform  
[00:57.70]Real ones feel me through the storm  

[01:01.50]Look — scars on my name like tags on a wall  
[01:05.30]Every cut, every fall, made me stand tall  
[01:09.10]Don’t ask if I’m good, I’m raw and I’m loud  
[01:12.90]I walk like a king through a treacherous crowd  

[01:16.70]This ain’t pride — it’s a battle cry  
[01:20.50]I see snakes when I scan the sky  
[01:24.30]You want truth? Better brace for heat  
[01:28.10]I don’t fake peace — I just press delete  

[01:31.90]This is me — all fire, all flaws  
[01:35.70]No leash, no script, no pause  
[01:39.50]I spit what I live, no filter, no fold  
[01:43.30]I’m not for sale — I already sold my soul
